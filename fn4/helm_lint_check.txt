helm lint
examine a chart for possible issues

Synopsis
This command takes a path to a chart and runs a series of tests to verify that the chart is well-formed.

If the linter encounters things that will cause the chart to fail installation, it will emit [ERROR] messages. If it encounters issues that break with convention or recommendation, it will emit [WARNING] messages.
